# Haz Gen2 Overlay

This is a repository for my use to replace the aging "gentoo-overlay" that I created.  This will contain ebuilds I create for tools that I use lacking an ebuild.

Currently includes:

- FlashPrint5: 3D Printing utility for older FlashForge3D 3D Printers.  Has a reliance on qtopengl v5.
